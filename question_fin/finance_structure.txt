Investment Banking Division (IBD) — Structure Overview (Product vs. Sector)

1) What “IBD” covers at the highest level
IBD generally combines two big workstreams:

A. Corporate Finance / Advisory (strategy + transaction advice)
- Helps clients decide what to do and how to structure it.
- Typical topics: M&A decisions, strategic reviews, restructuring.

B. Capital Markets / Execution (underwriting + issuance execution)
- Helps clients raise capital by executing equity or debt issuance.
- Typical topics: underwriting, marketing, pricing, syndication, and deal execution.

In practice, IBD is commonly organized along two axes:
- Product Groups (specialists by transaction / product type)
- Sector Groups (generalists by industry and client relationship)

This creates a “matrix”: Sector teams own client relationships and originate ideas; Product teams provide deep technical execution on specific transaction types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Product Groups (transaction specialists)
Product Groups are organized by the type of transaction/product and tend to be staffed by specialists who execute deals across many industries.

2.1 Advisory / Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)
Core focus: advice-driven, transaction-structure-centric work.
Typical mandate:
- M&A advisory (buy-side, sell-side, mergers)
- Strategic reviews (portfolio review, divestiture options, growth strategy)
- Restructuring (capital structure solutions, creditor negotiations, turnaround advisory)

2.2 Debt Capital Markets (DCM)
Core focus: debt issuance execution and market-facing coordination.
Typical mandate:
- Advise on debt structure (tenor, covenants, fixed vs. floating)
- Timing and market positioning; investor messaging
- Underwriting syndicate coordination and execution mechanics

2.3 Leveraged Finance / Origination
Core focus: financing for riskier credits and sponsor-driven deals, with an “origination” element.
Typical mandate:
- LBO / sponsor deal financing
- High-yield bonds and leveraged loans (depending on bank structure)
- Structuring complex capital stacks (multiple tranches, covenant packages)

2.4 Equity Capital Markets (ECM)
Core focus: equity issuance execution and interface with equity investors and market dynamics.
Typical mandate:
- Equity issuance strategy (market windows, structure)
- Underwriting, marketing, pricing, and execution coordination
- Equity story framing and investor communication support
(Note: ECM sits under the broader “Capital Markets / Execution” track in many org charts.)

2.5 “Product Group” mindset (why people choose it)
People drawn to Product Groups typically:
- Want a particular skill set and deeper specialization
- Prefer being a specialist vs. a generalist
- Focus on executing transactions (the “how” of deals)
- Interact with all sector groups (because products apply across industries)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Sector Groups (industry coverage and relationship owners)
Sector Groups (also called Industry Coverage) are organized by industry and typically:
- Own primary client relationships
- Generate ideas and originate transactions
- Provide deep industry context and long-term strategic dialogue
- Coordinate with Product Groups to execute deals

Common Sector Groups (as shown in the diagram)
- Consumer Products & Retail
- Financial Institutions (often called FIG: Financial Institutions Group)
- Healthcare
- Real Estate, Lodging & Leisure
- Power & Utilities
- Energy
- Industrials
- Private Funds (structure varies by bank; sometimes overlaps with Sponsors/FIG)
- Technology / Media / Telecom (TMT)
- Financial Sponsors (coverage of private equity and sponsor clients)

3.1 “Sector Group” mindset (why people choose it)
People drawn to Sector Groups typically:
- Want to build a toolbox of skills across multiple products
- Enjoy relationship-building with clients
- Have strong interest in a specific industry
- Interact with all product groups (because coverage teams pull in specialists as needed)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) How deals happen in the matrix (workflow)
A typical end-to-end workflow:
1) Sector coverage identifies a client need (growth, acquisition, refinancing, capital raise).
2) Coverage pulls in relevant product specialists:
   - M&A for strategic / deal advisory
   - DCM for debt solutions
   - Leveraged Finance for sponsor/LBO or higher-risk financing
   - ECM for equity solutions
3) Coverage + product teams run the process together:
   - Sector coverage: client communication, relationship management, industry narrative
   - Product groups: technical structuring, modeling support, execution steps, market coordination

Key takeaway
- Sector = relationship + industry + origination
- Product = transaction expertise + execution
- IBD works best when both collaborate tightly across the “product x sector” matrix
