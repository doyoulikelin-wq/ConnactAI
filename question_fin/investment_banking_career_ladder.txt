Investment Banking Career Ladder — Roles, Timing, and Responsibilities

Investment banks are often structured as a pyramid. As you move up the ladder, your work typically shifts:
- from technical execution (modeling/analysis) → to transaction leadership → to client relationship ownership → to revenue generation and franchise building.
