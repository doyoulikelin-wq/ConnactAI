Hi XYZ,

Good morning! My name is Ethan, a sophomore at NYU majoring in Economics and Data Science. Currently, I am interning at a wealth management firm advising professional athletes and College players under NIL, where I help with client outreach, relationships-building, and shadow senior during client calls to gain experience on personalized planning and communication drive long-term trust.

I saw that you are currently in the wealth management group at XYZ and would love to hear more about your experience, particularly how you approach client relationships and portfolio strategy at the firm. If you have some time in the coming weeks, I would really appreciate a quick call for any advice you might have for someone looking to pursue a career in your industry.

Thank you for your time. I have attached my resume below and am looking forward to chatting.

Many thanks,
Ethan Wang

Good morning Yonatan,

My name is Ryan, and I’m a sophomore at NYU Stern, majoring in Finance and History. Having an interest in investment banking, I have completed several boutique banking internships and will intern as a Global Investment Research Analyst at Goldman Sachs this summer.

My interest in real estate began during my internship at DBS Bank, where I covered real estate in the APAC region. I also plan to take Stern’s Real Estate Primary/Capital Markets course. I’d love to hear about your experience at Morgan Stanley Real Estate Group, your advice for someone pursuing a similar path, and your thoughts on Stern’s real estate course.

Would you be available for a 15-20-minute chat sometime in the coming weeks? Please see the attached resume for more information about my background. I’m looking forward to connecting with you soon!

Best regards,
Ryan

Hi XXX,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Allison, and I’m a sophomore at NYU Stern, majoring in Finance and Data Science. I’m reaching out because I’m very interested in [Company] and would love to learn more about your experience in the industry.

I’ve been fortunate to gain exposure to the finance world through internships at **Borex Capital, Melrose Legacy Partners and a couple of other Private Equity firms**, where I focused on conducting due diligence, market research, and deal evaluations. These experiences provided me with a solid understanding of buy-side businesses. I’ll also be joining **Wells Fargo** as an Investment Banking Summer Analyst next year, which I’m very excited about.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect with you for a brief chat to hear more about your career path and gather any advice you may have for someone in my position.【some personalize】

Thank you in advance, and I look forward to hearing from you!
